### A two-way bridge between Java and SWI-Prolog
Mochalog is a rich bidirectional interface between the Java Runtime and the SWI-Prolog interpreter inspired by [JPL](http://jpl7.org/). Looking to stand on its own two feet, however, Mochalog is focused on achieving two core design objectives:

* **API simplicity:** Reduce code complexity and learning curve. Increase maintainability. Use modern Java and Prolog software design practices. Prolog calls to Java should look like ***Java***, Java calls to Prolog should look like ***Prolog***.
* **Performance:** Calls between the two languages should be blazingly fast (as fast or **faster** than other existing Java-Prolog interfaces).
